# **YOLO Evaluation on Oxford Pets Dataset**

This repository contains a detailed evaluation of various YOLO versions on the Oxford Pets Dataset. The primary objective is to compare model performance in terms of accuracy (mAP), ability to detect small objects, and computational efficiency across different versions of YOLO.

## **2.1 Evaluate Layers, Parameters, and GFLOPs**

| **Model**   | **Layers** | **Parameters**  | **GFLOPs** |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|------------|
| YOLOv8s     | 225        | 11,166,560      | 28.8       |
| YOLOv9s     | 917        | 7,288,182       | 27.4       |
| YOLOv10s    | 402        | 8,128,272       | 25.1       |

- **Model Depth**:  
  - YOLOv9s has the highest number of layers (917), enabling deep feature learning, but this also makes training more complex and prone to vanishing gradients.
  - YOLOv10s also has many layers (402), providing deep learning capability, but itâ€™s less complex than YOLOv9s.
  - YOLOv8s has the fewest layers (225), making it easier to train, though its feature learning capability is not as deep as the other two models.
  
- **Number of Parameters**:  
  - YOLOv8s has the largest number of parameters (11,166,560), allowing it to capture more detailed features, but this also makes the model heavier and more resource-intensive.
  - YOLOv9s has the fewest parameters (7,288,182), making it more memory-efficient and lightweight.
  - YOLOv10s has a moderate number of parameters (8,128,272), providing a balance between learning capability and resource consumption.
  
- **Computational Efficiency (GFLOPs)**:  
  - YOLOv8s has the highest GFLOPs (28.8), meaning it has better processing power but also consumes more computational resources.
  - YOLOv9s and YOLOv10s have lower GFLOPs (27.4 and 25.1, respectively), optimizing for faster computation while maintaining a balance between speed and complexity.
  
- **Conclusion**:  
  - **YOLOv9s**: Suitable for tasks that require deep feature learning but comes with the challenge of complex training and moderate computational demands.
  - **YOLOv10s**: Balances depth and speed, being lighter than YOLOv9s, and ideal for applications needing efficiency in both speed and computation.
  - **YOLOv8s**: Easier to train but demands more resources, making it well-suited for complex tasks that require detailed feature learning.
